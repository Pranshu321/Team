# Team Registration Web App

This is web app which main work is to schuelde the match of the three different types of the games with the choice of the team name , location , type of the match like friendly & tournament. Now talking about the workflow.

## Workflow

1. The HomePage consists of the dropdown in which you have select the type of match like friendly or tournament.
2. According to the field selected in the previous select dropdown in which there is details of the match like location , comments about match and more.
3. Next Step will be the filling the details of the both team consisting of the team name and the location of the team is it away or home.
4. At last there is a displaying the data which is filled in all these forms.

## Routing

- The routing of website and component rendering is take care by the `app.jsx` and render the component as per the link visited.

## Home Page

- In this there is simple the `select element` and a `useState hook` which changes the link as per the field selected.
- And also pass the field `type` the data file.

## Match Details Form

- Here the simple use of the **Forms Handling** in react and also the some high concepts of css.
- Here also the data is pass to the file `data.js`.

## Team Details Form

- Somehow its same as the above in this also **Form Handling** is used.

## Preview Page

- This page consists of a table in which the data entered in the previous forms.
- The data in this componets is pass through the file where data is stored and passing as the props from app.jsx.

## Conclusion

While constructing this project , I have encourted many problems like while routing the components , taking cummilative data from different , Arranging them in table and at last passing props while routing. But must say I have leaned a lot and now more keen to join your organization and contribute in a constructive manner.
